## Features

- 💻 **Real terminal** — full SSH sessions (russh + xterm.js), tabbed, with splittable panes, plus local shell tabs.
- 🗂️ **Host vault** — saved hosts organised in folders with colours and favourites; secrets stored in the OS keychain; copy a ready-to-run `ssh` command for any host.
- 🔐 **Host-key verification** — first-connect fingerprint confirmation, `known_hosts` tracking, and a hard refusal with a warning if a host key ever changes (MITM protection).
- 📁 **SFTP browser** — dual-pane local/remote navigation with drag-and-drop transfer of multiple files and whole folders, a replace/skip conflict prompt, and remote create-folder / rename / delete.
- 🔀 **Port forwarding & SOCKS** — local (`-L`), remote (`-R`), and a dynamic SOCKS5 proxy (`-D`), all over the SSH connection. Keepalive keeps idle tunnels alive.
- 🛫 **Jump hosts (ProxyJump)** — reach a host through a saved bastion; the jump host's key is verified too.
- 📥 **Import `~/.ssh/config`** — pull existing hosts (and their ProxyJump links) straight into the vault.
- 📡 **Broadcast input** — type once, send to every split pane in a tab (cluster-ssh).
- 🔎 **Find & on-connect commands** — `⌘F` searches the terminal scrollback; each host can run a saved command (e.g. `tmux attach`) the moment the shell opens.
- 🎨 **Themes & settings** — community terminal themes with live font size, cursor, and scrollback controls.
- 💾 **Encrypted backup** — export and import your hosts and secrets as a password-encrypted file (PBKDF2 → AES-256-GCM).
- ⏳ **Idle vault lock** — optional passphrase lock after a period of inactivity.
- 🤖 **AI agent access (MCP)** — an optional, off-by-default MCP server bound to localhost behind a bearer token, with per-host opt-in and per-command in-app approval; secrets never reach the agent. See [docs/MCP.md](./docs/MCP.md).
- 🖥️ **Cross-platform** — built with Tauri 2 (Rust) for macOS, Windows, and Linux.

## Install

### Homebrew (macOS)

```sh
brew install --cask TanvirMahin24/sshache/sshache
```

### Direct download

Grab the latest platform build — `.dmg` (macOS), `.msi` (Windows), or `.AppImage` / `.deb` (Linux) — from the [Releases](https://github.com/TanvirMahin24/sshache/releases) page.

### Build from source

```sh
npm install
npm run tauri build
```

Building from source requires Rust and the Tauri toolchain. See the [Tauri prerequisites](https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) for platform-specific setup.

## Security

- **Host-key verification** — fingerprints are confirmed on first connect and tracked in `known_hosts`; if a host key ever changes, the connection is refused with a warning to guard against man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **OS-keychain secret storage** — passwords and keys live in the operating system keychain, not in plaintext config.
- **Encrypted backups** — exported hosts and secrets are sealed with PBKDF2 key derivation and AES-256-GCM encryption.
- **Approval-gated AI access** — the MCP server is off by default, bound to `127.0.0.1` behind a random bearer token, default-deny per host, and requires explicit in-app approval for every command; secrets are never exposed to the agent. Details in [docs/MCP.md](./docs/MCP.md).

Your data stays on your machine, encrypted at rest.
