# SSH Ache — brand spec

Single source of truth for logo, colours, copy, and links. Used by the app,
the README, and the sshache.com site so everything stays consistent.

## Forbidden copy (do NOT use these phrases anywhere)
`local-first`, `no telemetry`, `no account`, `account required`, `open source`, `MIT`, `MIT license`.
You may still say things like “your data stays on your machine, encrypted at rest” — just not the exact phrases above.

## Logo assets
- Mark (square / favicon / avatar): `src/assets/logo-mark.svg`
- Wordmark (banners / site header): `src/assets/logo-wordmark.svg`
The mark is a gradient app-tile with a cream heart and an embossed ECG/heartbeat
pulse — the heartbeat ties to the name (“ache”) and the life motto. For a
self-contained site, copy these SVGs into the site's own assets folder.

## What SSH Ache is (one-liner)
A desktop SSH client with a clean terminal UI — connections, SFTP, port
forwarding, and an approval-gated AI agent bridge, with your data kept on your
machine and encrypted at rest.

## Feature list (for marketing copy)
- **Real terminal** — full SSH sessions (russh + xterm.js), tabbed, splittable panes, plus local shell tabs.
- **Host vault** — saved hosts in folders with colours & favourites; secrets stored in the OS keychain; copy a ready `ssh` command per host.
- **Host-key verification** — first-connect fingerprint confirmation, `known_hosts`, and a hard refusal with a warning if a host key ever changes (MITM protection).
- **SFTP browser** — dual-pane local/remote navigation, drag-and-drop transfer of multiple files and whole folders, with a replace/skip conflict prompt.
- **Port forwarding** — local forwards bridged over the SSH connection.
- **Themes & settings** — community terminal themes, live font size / cursor / scrollback.
- **Encrypted backup** — export/import your hosts and secrets to a password-encrypted file (PBKDF2 → AES-256-GCM).
- **Idle vault lock** — optional passphrase lock after inactivity.
- **AI agent access (MCP)** — an optional, off-by-default MCP server bound to localhost behind a bearer token; per-host opt-in and per-command in-app approval; secrets never reach the agent.
- **Cross-platform** — built with Tauri 2 (Rust); macOS, Windows, Linux.

## Install (for docs)
- **Homebrew (macOS):** `brew install --cask TanvirMahin24/sshache/sshache`
- **Direct download:** platform builds (.dmg / .msi / .AppImage / .deb) from GitHub Releases.
- **From source:** `npm install && npm run tauri build` (needs Rust + the Tauri prereqs).
